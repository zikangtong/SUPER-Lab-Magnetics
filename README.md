##### Description:
This github repository contains all design automation scripts for our groups 3-D printed air-core magnetics projects. These files require both MATLAB and a valid COMSOL 5.4 license file which contains the AC/DC module and Livelink for MATLAB module. This repository contains all FEM model generation scripts in MATLAB. Below are instructions to run each file. We have also included example COMSOL .mph files for the structures listed in our publications. Below, we have provided links to the folders containing details and files for the various files.
